## Deployment Link: [DEMO](https://surfing-website-phi.vercel.app/)

## Rules To Code

1. Destructuring pages, each section is a separate component;
2. Module.scss is used;
3. Style files are placed in a folder next to the component;
4. Naming:

- Components: CamelCase + index.ts for import.
- Folders: folders of components with a CamelCase, for the rest kebabâ€‘case.
- CSS classes: CamelCase is used - className: blockName\_\_elementName.

6. If the component is not reused, then it is placed in the folder of the parent component.
7. The functional component is declaratively defined using an arrow function and prop type generics.
8. SVG images for interface decoration are stored in a folder `src/assets/icon`
9. Samples of user pictures are stored in a folder `public/images/componentName`
